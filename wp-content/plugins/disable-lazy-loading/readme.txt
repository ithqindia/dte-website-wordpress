Activate this plugin to disable the Lazy Loading feature that was added in WP v5.5.



== Description ==

> Does one thing: disables WP Lazy Load feature.

Activate this plugin to disable the new WP Lazy Loading functionality (added in WP version 5.5). To re-enable lazy loading at any time, simply deactivate the plugin.


**Features**

* Lightweight - only one line of code.
* Simple to use - activate and done.
* No permanent changes are made.
* No settings to worry about.
* Easy peasy.


**Why is this useful?**

Because there are plugins that already implement lazy loading. So when upgrading to WP v5.5, there may be conflicting or redundant functionality. That's not ideal. So with WordPress 5.5 and beyond, you can either remove your existing lazy-load solution, or more simply disable the WP-generated one. Or maybe you just don't want lazy loading on some particular site. Whatever the reason, this plugin will do the job with a click.
